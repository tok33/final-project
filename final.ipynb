    "I'm choosing to gather the best neighborhood for dogs based on the amount of parks in the neighborhood. I'm going to do so by determining the acreage of parks per neighborhood. There's a unique issue to tackle with my data set, in which the data set I have only displays the name of the park, not the name of the neighborhood. As a solution, I found a second data set that ties together park and neighborhood names. This way, I can gather all data using the park data set, then link each respective park to its neighborhood through a second data set."
